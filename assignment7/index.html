          <p>The Mona Lisa, painted by Leonardo da Vinci over 500 years ago, is one of the most
celebrated masterpieces of Renaissance art. Yet beneath its serene smile and cryptic gaze
lies a theory that has intrigued researchers for decades. Known as the Shift Theory, it
suggests that each time the Mona Lisa is physically relocated, the fabric of reality is subtly
altered.</p>
          <p>In the modern day the Mona Lisa has been moved six times. According to a lost Vatican
manuscript known as I Colori Dormono ("The Colors Sleep"), the seventh move will be the
most significant: "When the Lady moves for the seventh time, the frame will splinter, and
she will be free to walk again. Eyes wide. Hands empty. World new." This prophecy
suggests that her next relocation in Fall 2025 could mark a pivotal moment in human
history.</p>
