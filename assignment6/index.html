        <p>The Idea that our minds should operate as high-speed data-processing machines is not only built into te workings of the Internet, It is the networks reigning business model as well The faster we surf across the Web-the more links we click and pages we view-the more opportunites Google and other companies gain to collect information about us and feed us advertisements.</p>
        <p>What the Net seems to be doing is chipping away my capacity for concentration and contemplation. My mind now expects to take information the way the Net distributes it: in a switfly  moving stream of particles. Once I
was a scuba diver in a sea of words. Now I zip along the surface like a guy on a Jet Ski.</p>

        <p>I don't think the internet is necessarily making me think less deeply it's just changed the way I engage with information. My mind has adjusted to taking things in faster and from a lot of different sources. Instead of diving deep into one long article or book like I used to, I move through different topics and ideas more quickly, sometimes stopping to go deeper when something grabs me. It's not that I've lost the ability to focus just that I'm learning in a different way now, more through connections than concentration alone.</p>
        
        <p>Honestly, I think the internet has helped me become more flexible with how I think. Sure, I don't always read the same way I used to, but I still reflect I just do it in shorter bursts, or in between pieces of content. If I'm jumping around more, it's because there's so much out there to explore. I don't see that as a bad thing. It's just that the way we think and absorb ideas has evolved with the tools we use.</p>
