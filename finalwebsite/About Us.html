    <section class="intro">
        <p>At the European Historical Anomaly Committee (EHAC), we specialize in the investigation of unusual patterns in history, unexplained connections between major world events and overlooked details hiding in plain sight. Our mission is to shed light on phenomena that challenge conventional timelines, with a particular focus on the mysterious movements of the Mona Lisa.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="timeline">
        <p>EHAC was founded in the 1960s by a coalition of scholars, historians, and archivists who noticed a recurring trend: moments of global upheaval seemed to follow relocations of culturally significant artifacts. Over time, these anomalies formed a curious pattern, a pattern we now call the Shift Effect.

</p>
        
    <section class="theory">
        
        <p>While the Mona Lisa is central to our current investigations, EHAC's scope includes broader studies of art, architecture, and relics that may act as "anchors" in the historical continuum. We aim to understand how these items influence collective memory, cultural evolution, and possibly, the structure of reality itself.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="collaborations">
        
        <p>From assembling archives to decoding lost manuscripts, our work combines academic rigor with open-minded curiosity. We welcome skeptics, believers, and the merely curious to explore the threads of history with us.</p>
