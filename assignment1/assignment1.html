		<h1>Response to Kate Wagner</h1>

				<p>Kate Wagner breaks down how the internet has reshaped modern life, especially the way it blurs public and private spaces and encourages constant performance. She points out how online platforms push people to turn their personalities into content, and how this pressure can lead to burnout, anxiety, and a distorted sense of self. At the same time, she doesn't ignore the internet's role in building communities and giving people a voice it's this mix of connection and harm that makes her take so compelling.</p>

				<p>One of the biggest things she points out is how the internet, which is supposed to connect us, can actually make us feel more isolated. Social media was meant to help us stay in touch with friends or find new people who get us but instead, a lot of the time, it just feels kind of empty. Wagner argues that these platforms encourage quick, shallow interactions. People end up chasing likes, retweets, and validation instead of real connection, which just leaves everyone feeling more alone.</p>
				
				<p>She also talks about the "attention economy" basically, how our attention has become something companies want to monetize. Everything online is designed to keep us clicking and scrolling for as long as possible. Wagner calls out how this system shapes the kind of content we see: stuff that's flashy, dramatic, and meant to provoke a reaction rather than make us think. It's easy to get lost in all the noise, and harder to find anything that actually feels meaningful or worthwhile.
</p>
				
				<p>Another point she brings up is how the internet has changed the way we deal with time and patience. We're so used to getting everything instantly now whether it's streaming a whole season of a show or getting a notification the second someone likes our post. Wagner warns that this constant instant gratification has made it harder for us to sit with boredom, to wait, or even to focus. Our attention spans are shrinking, and that has real effects on how we engage with the world.</p>
				
				<p>She also doesn't ignore the darker parts of the internet especially when it comes to misinformation and the way online platforms influence politics. With so much stuff being shared nonstop, false info can spread super fast. And because algorithms are built to feed us more of what we already like or believe, people can end up stuck in their own little echo chambers. Wagner pushes for more accountability from tech companies and highlights the real-world consequences of letting these platforms run unchecked.</p>
				
				
				
				<p>Overall, Wagner's essay is basically a wake-up call. She's not saying the internet is all bad there are obvious upsides to it but she's asking us to think more critically about how we use it and what it's doing to us. Are we using the internet, or is it kind of using us?</p>
